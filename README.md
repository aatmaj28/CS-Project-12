'Journey to the Beyond' is a text-based story-driven choose-your-own-adventure game set in the year 2082. Your character is stranded on an alien planet, and your objective is to use your wits to figure out a way to escape it. It is a tough, yet rewarding game, which will force you to think out of the box, all without using a single pixel of graphics.
